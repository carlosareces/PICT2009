This section briefly describes the interaction of the authors with other international research groups.

Dr. Areces was member of the TALARIS group, part of the \emph{Laboratoire Lorrain de Recherche en Informatique et ses Applications}. The main research topic at TALARIS is computational linguistics with strong emphasis on semantics and inference and he is also collaborating with researchers and institutions specialized in these areas, in particular with \textit{Patrick Blackburn} (researcher in modal logics and computational linguistic applications), the GLyC group (\textit{Grupo de L\'ogica, Lenguaje y Computabilidad}, part of the Computer Science Department of the University of Buenos Aires) and \textit{Ron Petrick} (developer of PKS, one of the few planning systems able to construct conditional plans in the presence of incomplete knowledge).


Dr.\ Estrella is a former member of the \textit{Multilingual Information Processing Department
at the University of Geneva} (ISSCO/TIM) and of the \emph{Database management and meeting
analysis} group of the Swiss National Center of Competence in Research \emph{Interactive Multimodal Information Management}. She continues collaborating with TIM/ISSCO (focusing on the evaluation of NLP systems, the development of multilingual HLT systems and multimodality) and is currently collaborating with some members of the \textit{Pervasive Artificial Intelligence} group of the University of Fribourg.

Dr. Benotti has recently obtained her PhD at the TALARIS group and is currently collaborating with groups working on NL generation and dialogue systems, such as \textit{Alexander Koller} (organizer of the GIVE challenge and coordinator for the implementation of the GIVE platform), \textit{David Traum} (researcher on dialogue systems and head of the Institute for Creative Techologies), \textit{Claire Gardent} (vice-director of TALARIS, working on NLG, lexical acquisition and grammar development) and \textit{Agust\'in Gravano} (researcher on prosodic variation in spoken dialogue).
